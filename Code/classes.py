# Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

# A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

# A method is function that goes inside of a class

# class Person:
#     def __init__(self, name, age):
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = age
#
#     def myfunc(self):
#         print("Hello my name is " + self.name)
#
# p1 = Person("John", 36)
# p1.myfunc()
